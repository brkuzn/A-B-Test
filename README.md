# A/B Test
*************************************************************************
An interactive social media platform recently introduced a type of offer called “average bidding” as an alternative  to the current type which is “maximum bidding”. 

One of our customers decided to test this new feature and thus, wants to do an A/B test in order to understand whether average bidding provides more returns than maximum bidding.
This dataset includes our customer's website information. It also contains data on the number of advertisements that users view and click on, as well as earnings information from the website. The dataset consists of two separate sets: the control group and the test group.
